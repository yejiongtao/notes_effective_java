1. instanceof vs getClass
	c instanceof C
		true even if c is an instance of one of C's subclasses
	c.getClass() == C.class
		ensure that c is exactly an instance of C

2. Favor composition over inheritance
	It is safe to use inheritance within a package, where the subclass and the superclass implementations are under the control of the same programmers.
		It is also safe to use inheritance when extending classes specifically designed and documented for extension
	Inheriting from ordinary concrete classes across package boundaries, however, is dangerous
		for example, do not override HashSet, String or something
	use the Decorator Pattern to add features to them

3. Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it
